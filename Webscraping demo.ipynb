For example, sometimes it'll be JSON or XML data, and while that's just a plain text file (and thus can be stored as a string), the string structure doesn't know the ins and outs of that data format.  Meaning that while we can see it, write it, and manipulate it as text, we can't query it with that data format's native methods.\n",
